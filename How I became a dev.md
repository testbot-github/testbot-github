## The beginning
When I was browsing though youtube I found a video named - `how to make a discord bot free` in that they told to use botghost *BRUH*. then I started using botghost :eyes: I made some fake bots [some youtubers] then I uploaded to top.gg `kek` after some days I got banned from top.gg ðŸ˜¿ *lol*.

## I made an discord server for my yt channel
I created my own server [for yt] then after some days I searched how to host a discord bot through pc I searched how to code a discord bot in google then I found out there is something called "discord.js" but still i wasnt understand so I tried to copy codes from [GitHub](https://github.com) *bruh* then I found some open source codes so I was tried to use them in my PC but ..... my pc wasnt able to handle it was started lagging :pensive: I still didn't give up....

## The code editor
I searched google for online editors then I found [repl.it](https://repl.it) :partying_face: I runned many codes there and everything got unsuccessfull. Then I started cloning the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com) :heart: and used [repl.it](https://repl.it) test the code. It worked first time then I started editing the codes inside of those javascript. Then it made me learn some new things like variables. I even made my own custom messages. After clonning and editing many repos I learned how to make a Discord bot online with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) <img src="https://www.phpexperttechnologies.com/cp-admin/dynamic_folder/blog_image/5d8c88533f72cnode-js-new.png" width="15px"> After some days [repl.it](https://repl.it) was not loading in my pc I just got `"Failed..."` something error. Then i tried to found another code editor then I found [Glitch](https://glitch.com) <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/e200ca48-8caa-472f-b105-1ab0ed3d605d%2Fglitch-fish-big.png?v=1534344540198" width="15px">
