## The beginning
When I was 8 year old I play many games like Clash of clans *lol*. When I was playing I just thinked what if I made a game like this :eyes: I googled "How to make a game?" as i googled I just saw one thing called "Unity" and thats how I got interest in Developer

## Joined Discord
I joined discord after 3 years. Im 13 "Discord TOS". I created my own server and found some friends I invited them to my server. There I gave admin to my best friend called "Ryyan" my best friend we had play with many discord bots and I also got soemthing like "what if I made a discord bot" *again lol* I searched how to code a discord bot in google then I found out there is something called "discord.js" but still i wasnt understand so I tried to copy codes from [GitHub](https://github.com) :heart: I found some open source codes so I was tried to use them in my PC but ..... my pc wasnt able to handle it was started lagging :pensive: I still didn't give up....

## The code editor
I searched google for online editors then I found [repl.it](https://repl.it) :partying_face: I runned many codes there and everything got unsuccessfull. Then I started cloning the repo from [GitHub](https://github.com) :heart: and used [repl.it](https://repl.it) test the code. It worked first time then I started editing the codes inside of those javascript. Then it made me learn some new things like variables. I even made my own custom messages. After clonning and editing many repos I learned how to make a Discord bot online with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) <img src="https://www.phpexperttechnologies.com/cp-admin/dynamic_folder/blog_image/5d8c88533f72cnode-js-new.png" width="15px"> After some days [repl.it](https://repl.it) was not loading in my pc I just got `"Failed..."` something error. Then i tried to found another code editor then I found [Glitch](https://glitch.com) <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/e200ca48-8caa-472f-b105-1ab0ed3d605d%2Fglitch-fish-big.png?v=1534344540198" width="15px">
